The state vector is an element of a complex Hilbert Space \\mathbb{H}, called the space of states.\nWith every physical property \\mathcal{A}, there exists a corresponding linear, Hermitian operator A called an observable, which acts in the Hilbert space \\mathbb{H}.\n\nThe eigenvalues of these Hermitian operators are values of the physical properties.\n\n\n(Born Rule) If \\ket{\\psi} is the vector in \\mathbb{H} representing the state of the system, and \\ket{\\phi} represents a particular physical state of the system, we can define a probability P(\\ket{\\psi},\\ket{\\phi}) for finding \\ket{\\psi} in the state \\ket{\\phi}. This is given by,\n\nP(\\ket{\\psi},\\ket{\\phi}  ) = |\\braket{ \\psi | \\phi } |^{2}\nWhere $\\braket{ \\cdot | \\cdot }$ denotes the inner product defined on the Hilbert Space.\n\n4. (Wave function collapse) If A is an observable with the eigenvalues listed in the set \\{ a_{n} \\} and the eigenvectors listed in the set \\{ \\ket{n} \\}, and we have a system in a given state \\ket{\\psi}, the probability of obtaining a_{n} as the “outcome” of the measurement of \\mathcal{A} (the physical property corresponding to the observable), i.e. on the action of A on \\ket{\\psi} is given by,\nP(a_{n}) = |\\braket{ n | \\psi } |^{2}\nAfter such a measurement operation is done, the system is left in the state $\\ket{n}$, i.e the wave function $\\ket{\\psi}$ &quot;collapses&quot; to that state.\n\n5. The time-evolution of a closed system as described in Quantum Mechanics is unitary, i.e. reversible. The evolution is given by the time-dependent Schrodinger equation -\ni \\hbar \\frac{\\partial \\ket{\\psi}}{\\partial t} = H \\ket{\\psi} \nWhere $H$ is the **Hamiltonian** of the system, $\\hbar$ is the **reduced Planck constant**, and $i$ is $\\sqrt{ -1 }$.\n"},"bibliography.bib":{"slug":"bibliography.bib","title":"bibliography.bib","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"index":{"slug":"index","title":"Welcome to Quartz","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"This is a blank Quartz installation.\nSee the documentation for how to get started."},"preamble.sty":{"slug":"preamble.sty","title":"preamble.sty","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"\\usepackage{physics}\n\\newcommand{\\R}{\\mathbb{R}}\n\\newcommand{\\C}{\\mathbb{C}}"}}
