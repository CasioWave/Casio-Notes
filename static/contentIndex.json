The state vector is an element of a complex Hilbert Space \\mathbb{H}, called the space of states.\n\n\nWith every physical property \\mathcal{A}, there exists a corresponding linear, Hermitian operator A called an observable, which acts in the Hilbert space \\mathbb{H}.\n\nThe eigenvalues of these Hermitian operators are values of the physical properties.\n\n\n\n(Born Rule) If \\ket{\\psi} is the vector in \\mathbb{H} representing the state of the system, and \\ket{\\phi} represents a particular physical state of the system, we can define a probability P(\\ket{\\psi},\\ket{\\phi}) for finding \\ket{\\psi} in the state \\ket{\\phi}. This is given by,\n\n\nP(\\ket{\\psi},\\ket{\\phi}  ) = |\\braket{ \\psi | \\phi } |^{2}\nWhere \\braket{ \\cdot | \\cdot } denotes the inner product defined on the Hilbert Space.\n\n(Wave function collapse) If A is an observable with the eigenvalues listed in the set \\{ a_{n} \\} and the eigenvectors listed in the set \\{ \\ket{n} \\}, and we have a system in a given state \\ket{\\psi}, the probability of obtaining a_{n} as the “outcome” of the measurement of \\mathcal{A} (the physical property corresponding to the observable), i.e. on the action of A on \\ket{\\psi} is given by,\n\nP(a_{n}) = |\\braket{ n | \\psi } |^{2}\nAfter such a measurement operation is done, the system is left in the state \\ket{n}, i.e the wave function \\ket{\\psi} “collapses” to that state.\n\nThe time-evolution of a closed system as described in Quantum Mechanics is unitary, i.e. reversible. The evolution is given by the time-dependent Schrodinger equation -\n\ni \\hbar \\frac{\\partial \\ket{\\psi}}{\\partial t} = H \\ket{\\psi} \nWhere H is the Hamiltonian of the system, \\hbar is the reduced Planck constant, and i is \\sqrt{ -1 }.\nReferences\n\nQuantum Theory of Radiation Interaction - MIT OCW, Fall 2012\n"},"Quantum-Mechanics/Quantum-Information-and-Computation/Landauers-Principle":{"slug":"Quantum-Mechanics/Quantum-Information-and-Computation/Landauers-Principle","title":"Landauer's Principle","links":[],"tags":["information","thermodynamics","QM"],"content":"In 1961 Rolf Landauer pointed out that the erasure of information is necessarily a dissipative process. He saw that erasure of information always involves the compression of phase space, and thus it is irreversible.\nExample: Suppose we have a box with a partition in the middle, separating the box into “Left” and “Right” sections. We can store a bit of information in this box by keeping one molecule of gas in either the “Right” or the “Left” section. To erase the information here, we can choose to bring this molecule to the “Left” of the box, regardless of where it was originally (and then forget where we brought it from; that is essentially the “erasure”). We can do this by - 1. Removing the partition. This causes this “one molecule gas” to expand into the entire box, 2. Putting in a movable partition at the right wall of the box, and then moving it to “compress” the “one molecule gas” into the “Left” section. Now, in doing so, we do some work! If the process is isothermal (at some temperature T), then the work done on the box-gas system is given exactly by W = T \\Delta S = k T \\ln 2.\n\n“If I am to erase information, someone will have to pay the power bill” - John Preskill.\n"},"Quantum-Mechanics/Quantum-Information-and-Computation/Physics-of-Information":{"slug":"Quantum-Mechanics/Quantum-Information-and-Computation/Physics-of-Information","title":"Physics of Information","links":["Quantum-Mechanics/Quantum-Information-and-Computation/Landauers-Principle","Quantum-Mechanics/Quantum-Information-and-Computation/Reversible-computation"],"tags":["infomation","QM","Quantum"],"content":"\nInformation can be interpreted as “something” that is encoded in the state of a physical system.\nComputation can be interpreted as “something” that can be carried out on an actual physically realisable device.\nIf we interpret them this way, we can see that the study of these topics might be linked to the underlying physical processes.\n\nSome physical principles related to information and computation\nHere are some noteworthy discoveries in our understanding of how physics constrains our ability to use and manipulate information -\n\nLandauers Principle\nReversible computation\n"},"Quantum-Mechanics/Quantum-Information-and-Computation/Reversible-computation":{"slug":"Quantum-Mechanics/Quantum-Information-and-Computation/Reversible-computation","title":"Reversible computation","links":["Quantum-Mechanics/Quantum-Information-and-Computation/Landauers-Principle"],"tags":["information","computation","QM","thermodynamics"],"content":"Why computations can be irreversible\nNormally, the logic gates that are used in computation are irreversible. For example, look at the operation of a NAND gate:\n(a,b) \\to \\neg (a \\land b)\nThis takes in two bits, and outputs one bit - and we can not recover an unique input from the output bit. If we refer to Landauers Principle, we can see that since some information is erased in the process, at least W = k T \\ln 2 must be supplied to operate this gate.\nBennet’s method\nThus, if we have a finite amount of energy at our disposal, we can only carry out a finite number of computations.\nIn 1973, Charles Bennet found that any computation can be performed using only reversible steps - thus in principle we can compute without any power expenditure or dissipation.\nFor example, we can construct a reversible version of the NAND Gate (Toffoli Gate):\n(a,b,c) \\to (a,b,c \\oplus a \\land b)\nThis is a reversible 3-bit gate, which operates by flipping the third bit (c) if both the two first bits (a,b) take the value 1, and does nothing else otherwise. Here \\oplus is acting simply as a binary addition (without a carry, i.e. it adds and then selects the least bit). If c=1, then the third output bit from this gate is the NAND of a and b. This gate can, in principle, be carried out without any dissipation as for all output triplet we can find a unique input triplet.\nBut aren’t we generating a lot of junk in this computation? Technically, (a.b) bits are not useful in the result of the computation. Only c is required. So, we might want to delete this “junk” in the process of computation - which means that we are just postponing the energy cost of the computation.\nBennet countered this by proposing the following mode of action for the reversible computer - The computer carries out all the reversible computations it is required to do, prints the complete output (Note, printing is itself logically reversible), then reverses the computational steps to return to its initial configuration. This removes the junk without any energy cost!\nIn practice, most modern computers require energy dissipation that is orders of magnitude greater than the energy dissipation predicted by the Landauer Principle - so Bennet’s reversible computation method is not really important for them. But as we shrink the components of the computer, we might require Bennet’s method to beat the Landauer Limit - as otherwise the components can be damaged by the heat generated."},"index":{"slug":"index","title":"Welcome to Casio Notes!","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Hi!
