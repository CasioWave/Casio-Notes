This page highlights the custom styling and functionality implemented in this Quartz setup.\n1. Metadata &amp; Frontmatter\nNotice the metadata displayed at the top of this page (below the title). It pulls from the YAML frontmatter:\n\nDifficulty: Intermediate\nPrerequisites: Basic Markdown\nStatus: In Progress\n\n2. Typography &amp; Math\nThe site uses Comfortaa for headings and body text, and IBM Plex Mono for code.\nHere is some inline math: e^(i pi) + 1 = 0.\nAnd a block equation:\nintegral_(-infinity)^infinity e^(-x^2) dif x = sqrt(pi)\n3. Custom Callouts\nWe have customized callouts to match the Casio theme.\n\n\n                  \n                  Terminology \n                  \n                \n\nCasio Wave: A style inspired by retro-futurism and clean, functional aesthetics.\n\n\n\n\n                  \n                  Note \n                  \n                \n\nThis is a standard note.

Footnotes &amp; Popovers\nWe use footnotes that display as popovers on hover.\nThis is a statement with a footnote1.\nAnd here is another one2.\n5. Citations\nCitations are linked to the bibliography.\n\nEinstein’s famous paper [@einstein1905].\nA classic textbook [@griffiths2005].\nInformation theory [@shannon1948].\n\n6.
